- 👋 Hi, I’m @guardiansofthepack
- 👀 I’m interested in connecting humans with dogs, helping to build life long reltaionships that are mutually benefitial to live a happy, healthy life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to communicate with dogs to teach them acceptable behaviors while correcting unacceptable behaviors in the least intrusive, minimally adversive manner.
- 🦮 I’m looking to collaborate on any dog training or behavior modification, exercise or nutrition. My hope is to build software that solves problems to scale a professional dog-care business.
- 🏆 My ultimate goal is to keep as many dogs out of shelters as possible by building a nuturing and caring dog pack.
